      <description>What is PMGO - Permissionset Manager in Go for Salesforce.com This is a simple cli based tool that generates permissionset xml from a spreadsheet.
The advantage of this approach is that the permissions are mastered and tracked on a spreadsheet, generating permissionsets are not a costly exercise.
Since generation of multiple permissionsets at one go is simple, this allows the consultant to implement strategies that allow for overlapping common permissions and permissionset groups.</description>
